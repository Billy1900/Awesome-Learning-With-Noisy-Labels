# Learning With noisy labels
Designing supervised learning algorithms that can learn from data sets with noisy labels is a problem of great practical importance. This Blog I will give you a brief introduciton and worldview of this research area.

# 1. Context
Deep learning has several principle problems: 
- 1) deep learning requires a lot of data training 
- 2) do not have enough ability to migrate 
- 3) open inference problem 
- 4) principle is not transparent deep learning heavily relies on high quality annotation data, resulting in high time, labor cost; 
so, how to achieve semi-supervised, unsupervised learning is a very important problem.

The Learning with noisy labels situation is as follows:

- 1) In the initial phase, it has a certain amount of data of unknown annotation quality. There is a certain annotation data, which can be obtained through the search engine, the public dataset.
- 2) The annotation data is of low quality â€” with high or low annotation errors
- 3) it requires continuous manual input to constantly improve the quality of annotation. The form of human annotation may be with paid crowdsourcing, or with user feedback.

# 2. Survey
Before I introduce the research survey to you, I wrote a brief overview based on my view.

All of approaches in this area is to solve one problem: how to classify noisy data and clean data. And I classify all the approaches as two part as the following figure: one is to try to sturcture the noise distribution in dataset, the other is to build robust algorithm and model no matter what noise distribution.

And Then I will give some important surveys, not a long list:
- Label Noise Types and Their Effects on Deep Learning
- Image Classification with Deep Learning in the Presence of Noisy Labels: A Survey
- Learning from Noisy Labels with Deep Neural Networks
